# Bank Project

Shafan: 
1. The purpose of this project was to teach us how multifile projects work, along with how to work with other people on one repo, using branches and updating those branches to the main branch so we know how to collaborate for future reference, like in a professional setting for example.
2. So for my portion, bank.py, I was a little confused at first as I had forgotten about local hidden functions. I realized that the database that each class would have should not be filled upon creation, as it will be populated by entries from the functions in user.py! After having that understanding, the rest of the logic was somewhat easy as we had learnt how to do it most of what it reuqired previously in this class, and I have knowledge of coding in general.
3. Other people could use my reposoitory as their own bank system, though its very basic and doesn't include a user interface, by fork and cloning it to make their own additions and updates.
